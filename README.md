# Office-Deployment
A Script to automate the install and upgrades of Office 2013, 2016, and Office 365.

In order to use this script you will need to download the current versions of the Office Deployment Tool from Microsoft. You will need to download 1 file for 2013 based products and a 2nd file for 2016 based products. For licensing reasons I am not able to include the setup.exe files directly in this package.

You only need to download the Deployment Tools for the verion(s) of Office you are installing.

You can find the Office 2013 Deployment Tool here:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36778

After downloading, extract the files from the download. Place "setup.exe" in the directory "Office365-2013-2016-AIO\" of the Deployment Script Files.

You can find the Office 2016 Deployment Tool here:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117

After downloading, extract the files from the download. Place "setup.exe" in the directory "Office365-2013-2016-AIO\16\" of the Deployment Script Files.

Once the setup.exe files are in the correct directory, launch the script by double-clicking "1-Install-O365-2013-v3.0.cmd"

You will need to choose the menu options to update/download the offline setup files before you can install.

The "Read Me - Instructions.pdf" file is outdated and only from the 2013 version but the step-by-step instructions with pictures should still apply to installing the 2016 verions.

All download links were current as of time of writing. For more information and links to other scripts and tools visit:
